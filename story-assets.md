# Veil ARG: Story Assets & Puzzle Design

## Story Assets Overview

### 1. Luminyce Laboratory Documents

#### 1.1 Initial Discovery Reports
- Email chain between scientists discussing unusual brain patterns in test subjects
- Microscope images showing the nanochips (heavily corrupted/glitched)
- Lab report with sections redacted, hiding key information players must decode

#### 1.2 Scientist Logs
- Dr. Sarah Chen's personal logs documenting the progression of symptoms
- Video recordings of test subjects (presented as corrupted VHS footage)
- Hidden messages in seemingly routine maintenance reports

#### 1.3 Classified Documents
- Internal memos warning about Veil's influence
- Encrypted files containing chip schematics
- Emergency protocols (partially corrupted)

### 2. Veil Corporate Materials

#### 2.1 Marketing Materials
- Cheerful advertisements with hidden disturbing elements
- Company website with secret backend access
- Employee handbook with coded warnings from resistors

#### 2.2 Internal Communications
- Board meeting minutes discussing "Project Enlightenment"
- R&D reports on "flavor enhancement technology"
- Shipping manifests with coordinates hidden in batch numbers

## Puzzle Mechanics

### 1. Entry Point: The Warning
**Puzzle Type:** Hidden Message
**Story Context:** A Luminyce scientist leaves a warning about Veil
**Mechanics:**
- Website appears normal but contains hidden text visible when highlighting
- VHS tracking distortion reveals message when mouse moves across screen
- Audio static contains morse code message
**Solution:** Players must combine all three elements to get access code

### 2. The Laboratory Break-In
**Puzzle Type:** Pattern Recognition + Steganography
**Story Context:** Access Luminyce's secure servers
**Mechanics:**
- Security camera footage contains pattern of glitches
- Employee ID cards with hidden binary in profile photos
- Terminal login requires pattern recognition from previous clues
**Solution:** Creates access to internal documents

### 3. Decoding the Payload
**Puzzle Type:** Cipher + Audio Analysis
**Story Context:** Understanding how the chips work
**Mechanics:**
- Spectrogram analysis of "corrupted" audio files
- Chemical formulas that are actually coded messages
- VHS artifacts that form a cipher key when properly aligned
**Solution:** Reveals the chip's activation sequence

### 4. The Network
**Puzzle Type:** Network Puzzle + Geographic Coordinates
**Story Context:** Mapping Veil's distribution centers
**Mechanics:**
- Shipping manifests contain coded coordinates
- Restaurant locations form constellation patterns
- Menu prices are actually map coordinates
**Solution:** Reveals location of main control center

### 5. Breaking the Code
**Puzzle Type:** Multi-layer Encryption
**Story Context:** Stopping the 10-day countdown
**Mechanics:**
- Multiple ciphers that must be solved in correct order
- Video glitches that contain pieces of the master code
- Audio reversals containing verbal passwords
**Solution:** Provides shutdown sequence for chips

## Hidden Elements & Easter Eggs

### 1. VHS Interface Elements
- Tracking distortion reveals hidden text
- Static bursts contain frame-perfect images
- Color bars contain encoded messages

### 2. Audio Layers
- Background hum contains hidden messages
- Reversed audio clips with crucial information
- Static patterns that form spectrograms

### 3. Visual Secrets
- Glitch art with embedded codes
- Images that reveal different content when color-adjusted
- Seemingly corrupt pixels that form patterns

## Progression System
